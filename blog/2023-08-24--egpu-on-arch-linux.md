# eGPU on Arch Linux

This is for the time being only a note for further research,
but it should be possible to utilize the information in
[this](https://y.tsutsumi.io/2020/08/15/egpu-linux-core-x-chroma/)
blog post, which suggests using
[egpu-switcher](https://github.com/hertg/egpu-switcher)
to automatically detect and enable the eGPU.

The linked blog post is using Razor Core X Chroma,
but should theoretically work with others as well.
